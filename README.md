1. Put the contents of this folder on your USB Drive. You can leave out this read me file, the Default Theme Backup.zip, and Template.psd files if you want.

2. unplug the power from your PlayStation classic

3. Plug in the USB drive, plug the console back in and power it on.

Easy!

This does not modify any files on your system and goes back to normal upon reboot. (You have to unplug the power and plug it back in and power it on without the USB drive for it to go back to normal)

To make a new theme background, use the Template.psd Photoshop file and save your image as "JP_US_BG.png". Put it in the theme\images\GR folder on your USB Drive and replace the existing file.

If you don't have photoshop or just want to customize even more than the background you can edit any of the files in the theme folder.

Again pretty easy!
